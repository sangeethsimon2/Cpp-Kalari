Experiment 'Square symmetry(random pts)' indicates
the unit test named LargePointCloudOnAnUnitSquareSymmetryAboutHorizontalAxis
in which a random set of points are distributed over a unit square centered at 0,0
such that these are symmetrical over the line y=0.

Experiment Circle nonsymm(random pts) indicates the unit test named
'LargePointCloudSymmetryAboutDiagonalOfACircle_randomPoints' in which a random set of
points are distributed over the circumference of a unit circle centered at 0,0.

Experiment Circle nonsymm(random pts) indicates the unit test named
'LargePointCloudSymmetryAboutDiagonalOfACircle_symmetricalPoints' in which a predefined set of
points that are symmetrical ( some of them lying on potential symmetry line as well)
are distributed over the circumference of a unit circle centered at 0,0.
